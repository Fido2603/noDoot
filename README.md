## What the hell is noDoot
noDoot is a Discord bot developed by HeroGamers#0001, which denies Userbots from joining your guild, effictively stopping all DM and server spam from those bots that have been quite active on Discord lately.  
noDoot works by taking users who are joining a server, and kicking them if they aren't verified. The users are, before getting kicked, sent a DM from the bot to go verify their account through the noDoot Verification Server, where the user then is sent a Captcha through their DM's from the bot. Once verified, the user will be able to join all servers using noDoot, and should never need to do the verification ever again. Don't we all hate Captcha's?

### How do I get rid of UserDoots on my server
**WARNING BEFORE ADDING THE BOT: Some users may not be able to join, and I, Hero, am not responsible for such cases, especially duing the development stage. All use of the bot is at your own risk!**  
Well, you can invite noDoot to your servers, and thus enable the verification process on them, using this invite link: <https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=592829567660457985&scope=bot&permissions=2>.  
During the development stage the bot will most likely have some restarts here and there, and there will most likely be bugs!
