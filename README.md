## What the hell is NoDoot
NoDoot is a Discord bot developed by HeroGamers#0001, which denies Userbots from joining your guild, effictively stopping all DM and server spam from those bots that have been quite active on Discord lately. NoDoot works by taking users who are joining a server, and kicking them if they aren't verified. The users are then getting sent a DM from the bot to go verify their account through the NoDoot Verification Server, where the user then is sent a Captcha through their DM's from the bot. Once verified, the user will be able to join all servers using NoDoot, and should never need to do the verification ever again.
